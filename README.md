### Required packages

This project requires **Python 2.7** with following packages:
numpy, pandas: for reading and processing the dataset
matplotlib: for making plots in the notebook

keras: for building and training neural network models. 

### Code and dataset

Code used for this project is provided in the `predict_car_price.ipynb` ipython notebook file.

The data file is in the ‘autos.csv’ csv file and should stored in the same directory of the ipython notebook file. The dataset can be obtained from the following link:
