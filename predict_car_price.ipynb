    "In the used car market, one important problem is to determine a used car's price. A seller always tries to sell the car with a price as high as possible. Meanwhile, price of a car is often a very significant factor for the costumer's choice of buying. So, an effective estimation of price would provide very useful guide for both the sellers and buyers when dealing with a used car. Generally speaking, the determination of a used car's price depends on its brand, model, year of usage, and many other factors. This makes the determination of a used car very complicated. Therefore, a machine learning method would be proper to explore the hidden relation between those factors and the used car's price.\n",

    "Once the model is established, it can provide some references to other problems as well. For example, evaluating the attrition of a current processed car, or predicting whether a car needs to be replaced. "

    "1. More than 78% of the data have prices less than \\$10000. So train data for cars with prices higher than $10000 is in a small size. The inaccurate prediction to cars with high actual prices may be due to inadequate data for training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The price of the advertised used car is not the exact value of that car. Because that price is affected by personal factors of an advertiser, so this price is not only determined by the details of a used car, but also related to the advertiser. However, there is no information about the advertiser in the dataset. Therefore, the inaccurate prediction to cars may also be due to inadequate information from the dataset."

We plot the absolute error for records ordered by actual prices to see if that conclusion makes sense. From the plot, it is seen that for most records with actual prices less than $10000, the absolute error keeps low. As long as the actual prices gets higher, the absolute error gets higher as well. Meanwhile, when the actual price is extremely low, the absolute error is also in a high level."
